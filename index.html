      <h1>Hoiii Akka, HAPPY BIRTHDAY to a very special person in my life! I don’t even know where to start, but you are the one I give the most importance to, and I’m very grateful to have you in my life. I know we are not bound by blood, but you are family to me. I’d choose you a thousand times over as my sister. I thank the universe every single day for bringing you into my life💖.

We have shared so much together, and every single memory with you is unforgettable. Do you remember the first time you talked to me? You asked me, “Who is your crush?” 😁

There’s something about our bond that I can’t explain in words. You are the only one who stands by me even in my hardest times. You celebrate my wins like they are your own, and you feel my pain like it’s yours too. That kind of loyalty and love you show me is priceless. I never want to lose you in my lifetime.

After my parents, you are the one who gives me importance and understands me every single time. I feel very comfortable with you, so I share every big and small thing with you. You know my heart better than anyone else.

You have been my safe space, my backbone, my mirror (someone who knows me even when I don’t say a word). No matter where we are after 2nd year, a part of me will always be with you.

They say blood makes sisters, but you and I? We rewrote that truth. Our bond was never born from DNA but from a thousand shared smiles.

Hmmm… I can’t express everything in English, so let me say this in Telugu 😅
Akka, asalu ninnu first time 9th class lo chusinappudu manam inthaaa close avthaam ani assalu anukoledhu… nenu enti, nuvvu kuda anukoledhu le 😅. Asalu ah school days eh veru!

Inkaa cheppali ante akka… nenu eppudu badha lo unna, nenu cheppakunda nuvve kanipettav. 10th class lo gurthundhaa mana pre-finals appudu Jagadeesh vala nanna incident ayinappudu, nenu chala badha lo unna… andharu Sankranti fest lo enjoy chestunte, nuvvu vachi ma class lo natho kurchoni nannu odharinchav 🥺. Appudu evvaru nannu patinchukoledhu nuvvu thappa… andhuke nenu ninnu chala istam and respect chestha.

Enni rojulu ayina, enni years ayina, enni changes ayina mana bond mathram marchipokunda promise chey akka 🥺.

Nenu niku okkate cheptunna akka—ekkada unna santoshanga undu, ekkadiki vellina safe ga undu. Avasaram vaste niku oka thammudu unnaadu ani gurthuchesuko 💗.

Thank you for being by my side every time.
Thank you for supporting me every time.
Thank you for encouraging me in everything.
Thank you for understanding me every time.

You’re not just a part of my past; you’re a piece of my soul.
And no matter where life takes us…
You’ll always be my sister.
You’ll always be my home.
You’ll always be my Siri.
