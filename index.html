      <h1>Happy birthday, madam garuu!! 🎈🥳 Can't believe it's been over half a year since we met. From the moment I saw you at freshers, I knew I wanted to be friends enduko telidu, and I'm so glad you agreed to be friends with me when I reached out. Our friendship has been such a wonderful journey, and I truly consider you my first girl best friend in college. You're such an awesome, generous, and sweet person, and I’m grateful to have you in my life. 🤍 The moments we've shared with our gang are ones I’ll always treasure.🫶🏻 No matter what happens,our bond will never break nor change, you will always be my best friend and a sister to me, Veena garu. Here's to many more years of this amazing bond and friendship, because some connections are meant to last a lifetime! ✨
Hope you have an amazing year and enjoy it to the fullest! 🎉
