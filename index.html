      <h1>Happy birthday, madam garuu!! Our friendship is a beautiful journey, and I can genuinely say that you are one of the best things that happened to me in college. I don’t know how this journey started, but your presence has brought immense joy into my life. Mana friendship short time lo entha strong ayindo chudandi, and everything started with that group chat! 
meku inkosari doubt rakudadhu that no one cares about you ani. Nenu me tho eppudu untanu andi.

Can't believe it's been over half a year since we met, yet it feels like we've known each other forever. You are such a wonderful, caring, lovely and kind-hearted person, and I’m so grateful to have you in my life. Among all the beautiful moments in my life, the ones with you are the most precious.

The memories we've created with our gang are priceless. Every minute, every deep conversation, every teasing moment—each one is etched in my heart. Meeru chesina chinna chinna gestures kuda naaku chala important andi. No matter what happens, our bond is unbreakable, Babitha garu. Some friendships are meant to last a lifetime, and ours is definitely one of them.

Madam garu, people like you are rare. Your caring nature, amazing personality, and beauty—everything about you is special. Maybe we don’t express it often, but trust me, your presence makes our lives better in ways words cannot describe.

The way you talk to me, the care you show—it makes me feel truly valued. Even if we haven't shared too many conversations, each one is unforgettable. The affection, trust, and care you show—only a few people are capable of that. You are truly a blessing in my life. "Aap meri pyaari dost hain." Every moment spent with you feels magical. Whenever I feel low, you lift my spirits, and that means a lot to me.

I cherish every single moment spent with you. The time I have spent with you all has been one of the best parts of my life. I used to be hesitant to talk to girls, but you made me feel comfortable and helped me open up. Thanks for agreeing to go out with me, madam garu. We might have spent a lot, but the memories we made are priceless.

Our pictures, selfies, videos, teasing moments, conversations—they are all blissful. I am so thankful to those who created our group chat, because through it, I found an amazing friend like you. Madam garu, naaku chala takkuva time lo chala close friend ayipoyaru andi! Ee bond eppudu break avvakudadhu, next year inka inno memories create cheyyali ani korukuntunna.

The thought of you leaving for the hostel makes me feel something indescribable. I don’t know why, but the idea of not seeing you every day makes my heart ache. In my 10 years of school life, I have never connected with anyone this deeply. I just pray and hope that you never forget me and that our bond remains the same forever. Babitha garuu, you are the most beautiful, most caring, most amazing, cutest, and most lovely person.

I will make sure to meet you every time you come from the hostel. No matter what, if you ever have a problem, need help, or just want to share something, I promise I will always be there for you. You always say that you don’t have anyone, but that’s not true—we all are here for you. You accepted me wholeheartedly, and I will always stand by you.

I can’t put into words how much gratitude and love I have for you. No matter how much I say about you, it will never be enough. I regret not meeting you earlier in life. If you had come into my life sooner, it would have been even more beautiful.

"Teri muskurahat hamesha waise hi bani rahe, kyunki yahi toh hamari dosti ki roshni hai. Main kabhi bhi aisa kuch nahi hone dunga jisse tujhe humari dosti par afsos ho. Yeh dosti kabhi nahi badlegi, chahe kuch bhi ho jaye. Tu hamesha meri best friend rahegi, meri pyaari dost."

I am truly sorry, madam garu, if I have ever hurt you—it was never my intention. No matter how long we go without talking, our bond will never change. When you said you feel comfortable with me, I felt truly happy. Even if we don’t get to spend much time together, let’s make sure to meet when you come back from the hostel. After boards, we will create unforgettable moments, and I can’t wait for that. Being with you brings me so much happiness.

Hope you have an amazing year and enjoy it to the fullest! 🎉
once Again, wishing you a Very happy Birthday madam garu🎈 Happy birthday, madam garuu!!</h1>
